The FizzBuzz project developed by Grace on July 26 2017. 

This is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.   

However,   
   
For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number;      
For the multiples of five print “Buzz”;           
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz”.

A new application "CopyCatFizzBuzz" was developed on July 27 2017.
